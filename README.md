# Data-Science

## Unsupervised Machine learning:
* [Decision Trees](https://github.com/akshaypathak711/Data-Science/tree/master/Decision%20Trees): To predict is if the lender would get a return on his investment 
* [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/akshaypathak711/Data-Science/tree/master/SVM): Analyzing breast cancer data to enable early prediction of brest cancer

## Supervised Machine learning:
* [Linear Regression](https://github.com/akshaypathak711/Data-Science/tree/master/Linear%20Regression): Simple exercise to use various packages in Python (Scikit-learn, Seaborns, Matplotlib,etc.)

## Project
* Telecom Data Churn analysis: Service industries invest millions of dollars to ensure that customers feel welcomed and become brand loyal. The market is very competitive, and the business needs to keep their customers interested in their services. This report basically focuses on the fact that big industries have high rate of customer attrition and through this project, we are trying to find out ways to control it. The data under study is picked up from Kaggle. It talks about the various enrollment features of a customerâ€™s plans. Different visualization provides a brief understanding about the impact of each predictors in determining the churn rate, in order to identify key features heuristically. We then move to various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Linear Discriminant Analysis, for analyzing these features and identifying major predictors responsible for customer attrition. These models are compared and evaluated based on accuracy. We have provided recommendations to prevent customer attrition for different domains by leveraging customer behavior and domain expertise.
